A tool that automatically translates presentations (Google Slides and PowerPoint) between languages while preserving formatting, images, and slide structure.

## The Problem

Translating a 50-slide presentation manually takes hours. Copy text, translate, paste back, fix formatting that broke. Repeat for every text box, table cell, and speaker note.

Existing translation tools either:
- Don't preserve formatting
- Can't handle complex layouts
- Produce awkward machine translations

## The Solution

Feed the tool a presentation and a target language. It:

1. **Extracts all text** including tables, SmartArt, and speaker notes
2. **Deduplicates content** to reduce translation costs (repeated phrases only translate once)
3. **Translates via Claude** for natural, context-aware output
4. **Rebuilds the presentation** with translated text in the original formatting
5. **Creates a copy** rather than overwriting the original

## Key Features

### Format Preservation

The tool maintains:
- Font styles, sizes, and colors
- Text positioning and alignment
- Table structures and cell formatting
- SmartArt and diagram layouts
- Image placement

### Smart Deduplication

Corporate decks often repeat phrases: product names, taglines, legal disclaimers. The tool identifies duplicates and translates each unique string once, then applies the translation everywhere it appears.

### Multiple Formats

Supports both:
- **Google Slides** via the Slides API (creates a translated copy in your Drive)
- **PowerPoint (.pptx)** via direct file manipulation

### Progress Tracking

Real-time progress bar showing percentage completion. Useful for large decks that take several minutes to process.

## Technical Approach

The architecture separates concerns cleanly:

1. **Extraction layer** handles format-specific parsing
2. **Translation layer** batches requests to Claude
3. **Reconstruction layer** applies translations back to source format

This separation means adding support for new formats (Keynote, for example) only requires new extraction and reconstruction modules.

## Use Cases

- **Sales teams** localizing pitch decks for regional markets
- **Marketing** adapting campaign materials across geographies
- **Training departments** translating onboarding materials
- **Executives** preparing presentations for international meetings

## Limitations

- Complex animations may not transfer perfectly
- Embedded videos remain in original language
- Very large presentations (200+ slides) may hit API rate limits
