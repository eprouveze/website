Hey, this is a voice memo. An idea for an article I'd like to write and be publishing on LinkedIn, I don't know, or on my personal blog. About why I'm always smiling at work.The thing is, this morning someone reminded me—we started a meeting at 8:00 AM, it was quite early, I was still sleepy. But she said, "Why are you always smiling?" and she said it in a positive way, of course; she was impressed that I was always smiling. And my answer at the time was, well, first of all, thank you, but a lot of people do tell me that, in fact, and it is really true. And my answer at the time was: "Well, because I'm having fun at work."And that reminded me that as we begin our new fiscal year this week, a lot of the leadership at Salesforce in Japan have been including in their key messages for the year the word "fun." Let's have fun. Let's make sure that as a team we're having fun while working. And I like that, obviously; it's a good thing and it's very aligned with my own ideas.But going back to why—why am I smiling? I think there are many components to that. One of them might be that I am actually enjoying the work I do. I truly like it. I think I'm the right person for the job, and this job is the right one for me. The right company. That's one thing, and I could go into more detail on that later on, maybe.The other thing is, broadly speaking, as a person, and my personal interests, what makes me happy to wake up in the morning and motivated to wake up in the morning is, in the long term, to change the world through technology. Or more precisely: change society through software. I know that may sound catchy and... I don't know the right word in English, but it's really something that matters. So, changing society, changing how I can impact people's lives through software is really something that I enjoy doing.And that's exactly what I'm doing. I've been working for 30 years in software sales. And I mean, you could say that being in a sales role means that my role is to make money for my company, and maybe also provide tools to companies to allow them to make more money. And of course, that's true, and that's a fulfilling part of my job. But that's not all. When you're in a sales position selling software, you get the chance to promote a technology that will change thousands, tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of people's lives in a meaningful way.Consider even making someone's job 10% more efficient. Every day, they get 10% of their life back, or they can use those 10% to do something else or something more. That's a huge impact on their life, don't you think so? And being in that position to impact the lives of many, many people, that's something that I find very exciting and fulfilling and satisfactory.Of course, like everyone else, we have bad days. Things that are troubling us, things not going well. Of course, there are always those days. But I guess probably I have found a way to not let those bad things impact my mood in a long-lasting way. It will impact me in the short term, but I always process it, find ways to absorb it. Maybe in some cases, do my best to try and find the good within the bad, and that helps me process it and avoid getting into a dark mood.And I mean overall, I think I'm more of a glass-half-full person. That means that I have a tendency to be optimistic, not pessimistic. Optimistic. Which probably makes it easy for people to interact with me because I look at the bright side of things all the time. So it probably helps me as a leader to lead people, push people forward, get the best out of them, things like that, probably. And motivate them, just simply.Of course, there are downsides to being too optimistic. I mean, it takes me a conscious effort to consider the worst-case scenarios and prepare for them. I do that, of course, but it does take a conscious effort. Which, in turn, also means that being optimistic, my forecasts are probably on the optimistic side—still very accurate, but on the optimistic side for sure.What else? Let me see how long is my recording... 14 minutes. Okay. What is the message I want to get through? Because until now it just feels like a feel-good piece with no real learnings. So I probably need to find some stronger message that would come across in a positive way to people that would be reading the article.I'm trying to think about how I organize my work, and maybe how that in turn impacts my positivity and the reason I'm smiling. Overall, I think being "lazy," being a procrastinator, helps me prioritize what is important to achieve my goals in my job, in my mission. What is the most important thing? And in turn, what are the things that I do not need to do? So it's about removing things from my calendar, from my mind, and keeping it clear to set the vision, set objectives, consider how to achieve those objectives, what are the actions.By removing all the obstacles or things that I probably won't have an impact in, or cannot have an impact in—things that are not important to achieve the goals I have set—it helps me free time to have that clear mind about why I'm doing this job and where I am.The other one is, while being in a leader position and working with a great team all over the world, it would be very easy to create a system where everyone would have to go through me for decisions, for authorizations, for any kind of work that needs approval. And that might give some people a sense of being proud or feeling important, but again, it's just about creating busy work that doesn't really make the team more efficient.I try to avoid becoming the bottleneck in how our team operates. That, in turn, gives me the liberty, the freedom, and the time to spend time where it matters—where it's important because those are places where someone needs guidance, someone needs help, someone needs advice on how to move forward in a difficult situation. And I do have, in that time, the energy and space in my head to help them and focus on them and spend as much time as needed to solve the problem together.So, I try not to be the bottleneck, but at the same time, that gives me time to be there when and where it matters. Hopefully, that makes sense. And maybe indirectly, as a consequence of that, that work in turn makes a positive impact, hopefully at least most of the time. Which in turn is fulfilling to myself because I feel I've actually been able to contribute in a meaningful way.I use the word "meaningful" quite a lot. Maybe that's not by chance. I mean, everyone is looking for a meaning to their own life. We want to have a meaningful life. We want to find what's the meaning of our life. Not to get philosophical here, but you see what I mean. In my case, it's rather simple. I did say at the beginning: I want to change people's lives, and I want to do that through software.We could go on and on about why software and why one single person would like to have such an ambitious objective in life. Maybe it's too ambitious; maybe the impact I'm actually having on people is minimal. I don't know. But even if it's just one minute per day for 10,000 people, that's 10,000 minutes per day that people have been happier. So maybe it's not meaningless.How do people find what's meaningful for them? What's the meaning of your own life? I think I found mine. And having that clarity is also what makes me happy and joyful and smiling—smiling when I meet people, smiling when I'm working on things that I like, smiling when I get in the office and see people, smiling when I start a meeting.Yeah, I think that's it. So maybe I'll find an additional insight or advice or thing to link to people, but at least that's what I have for now.
