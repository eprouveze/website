It was an 8 AM meeting. I hadn't had my coffee yet. I was still half-asleep.

A US colleague looked at me on the screen, genuinely curious.

"Why are you always smiling?"

I gave her a simple answer in the moment: "Because I enjoy my work."

But later, I thought about it. Why am I smiling?

It isn't because the job is easy. It isn't because we don't have bad days. It isn't just because the "culture is great."

I realized my optimism comes from three specific disciplines.

First, I focus on the meaning, not the math. I have spent 30 years in software sales. My targets are numbers. But what gets me out of bed is the narrative behind them. When software works, it changes people's lives. A person who used to wait for answers can now find them. A team that was dependent becomes autonomous. If you focus only on the quota, this job is a grind. If you focus on the change you are enabling, it becomes a mission. That distinction changes your energy.

Second, I remove myself from the workflow. Some leaders find validation in being the bottleneck. They want to sign off on everything. I find that exhausting. I smile because I try to make myself unnecessary for the routine. This frees me to be present where it actually matters. When someone is stuck. When the situation is ambiguous. Leadership isn't about being everywhere. It is about being available where it counts.

Third, optimism is a practice, not a mood. I am naturally a glass-half-full person. But in business, optimism without realism is just wishful thinking. Deals fall through. Plans collapse. When they do, I don't ignore the outcome. I process it, find the utility in the failure, and move forward. I smile because I refuse to let the setbacks define the day.

My colleague saw a smile. What she was really seeing was clarity. Clarity on why I am here, how I lead, and how I handle the hard stuff.

Finding that meaning doesn't make the work easy. But it does make it enjoyable.

What makes you smile in your role? I'd love to hear.
