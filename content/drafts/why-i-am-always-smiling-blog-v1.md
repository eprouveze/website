# Why I'm Always Smiling

It was an 8 AM meeting. I hadn't had my coffee yet. I was still half-asleep.

A US colleague looked at me on the screen, genuinely curious.

"Why are you always smiling?"

I gave her a simple answer in the moment: "Because I enjoy my work."

But later, I thought about it. Why am I smiling?

It isn't because the job is easy. It isn't because we don't have bad days. It isn't just because the "culture is great."

I realized my optimism comes from a few specific disciplines I've developed over time. Not personality traits. Practices.

## Meaning, not math

I have spent 30 years in software sales. My targets are numbers. But what gets me out of bed is the narrative behind them.

When software works, it changes people's lives. A person who used to wait for answers can now find them. A team that was dependent becomes autonomous. Someone who needed a specialist can now act on their own.

If you focus only on the quota, this job is a grind. If you focus on the change you are enabling, it becomes a mission. That distinction changes your energy entirely.

I want to change people's lives through software. That sounds grand, maybe even naive. But even if the impact is small, even if it's just ten minutes saved per day for ten thousand people, that's ten thousand small improvements in how people work and live. That matters to me.

## Staying out of my own way

Some leaders find validation in being the bottleneck. They want to sign off on everything. Every decision flows through them.

I find that exhausting. And counterproductive.

I've learned to be what you might call "strategically lazy." Not lazy in the sense of avoiding work, but ruthless about what actually needs my attention. What are the things I probably won't have an impact on? What are the things that aren't important to achieve the goals I've set? Those get removed from my calendar, from my mind.

This isn't about delegation for its own sake. It's about keeping a clear head. When I'm not drowning in routine approvals, I have the mental space to set vision, think about objectives, and actually be present for the moments that matter.

I try to make myself unnecessary for the routine. This frees me to be available where it actually counts. When someone is stuck. When the situation is ambiguous. When a difficult executive decision is needed.

Leadership isn't about being everywhere. It is about being available where it counts.

## Optimism as practice

I am naturally a glass-half-full person. But in business, optimism without realism is just wishful thinking.

Deals fall through. Plans collapse. Bad days happen.

When they do, I don't ignore the outcome. I process it, find the utility in the failure, and move forward. The goal isn't to avoid negative feelings. It's to not let them set up permanent residence.

This takes effort. I've learned to make a conscious effort to consider worst-case scenarios. I build that discipline deliberately, because optimism without realism is just wishful thinking. But I'd rather build that muscle than default to pessimism.

I smile because I refuse to let the setbacks define the day.

## The AI parallel

This same principle, being available where it matters, is how I think about AI.

Not as a tool that handles the tedious while I do the "important" work. As a collaborator that thinks with me, so I can be present where it matters.

The best leaders and the best AI systems share the same design principle: create space for humans to do what humans do best.

## What she was really seeing

My colleague saw a smile.

What she was really seeing was meaning. Meaning in the work. Meaning in how I lead. Meaning in the mindset I've built over time.

Finding your meaning doesn't make work easy. But it does make it enjoyable. And when you enjoy what you do, it shows.

Do you know what makes you smile in your job? If you do, hold onto it. If you're still looking, it's worth the search.
