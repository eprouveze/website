# Content Guidelines: LinkedIn/Blog for AI Career Development

## Author Context

**Role**: Client Managing Director at Salesforce Japan
- 20+ years enterprise sales experience
- NTT as main account
- Building a portfolio showcasing Salesforce expertise + hands-on AI experimentation

## Content Formats

- **LinkedIn posts**: 500-800 words
- **Blog pieces**: Longer form for personal site
- **Topics**: Personal AI projects, lessons from Japanese enterprise sales, AI landscape observations

## Purpose

1. Establish myself as a business leader who **builds**, not just talks about AI
2. Share learnings from personal experiments that complement professional work
3. Explore the intersection of enterprise sales and AI adoption
4. Build thought leadership in the Japan market

## Salesforce Alignment (Critical)

- **Never** position personal projects as solving problems Salesforce products don't solve
- Frame projects as **personal curiosity and hobby coding**, not work tools
- When relevant, highlight how Salesforce is moving in similar directions (Agentforce, Generative Canvas, Trust Layer)
- Tone: enthusiastic practitioner exploring AI, **not** frustrated employee working around limitations

## Tone and Style

- First person, direct, specific
- Lead with concrete experience, not theory
- Honest about what worked and what didn't
- No corporate jargon, no hype
- Short paragraphs, punchy sentences

## Projects to Draw From

| Project | Description | Framing |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Forecasting experiments | GenUI concepts, prompt engineering learnings | Personal exploration of generative UI patterns |
| HealthPulse | Claude as health coach, personal AI dashboard | Clearly personal, health-focused, not work-related |
| ai-deck-translator | Google Slides translation tool | Personal productivity for multilingual life |
| Digital twin | Gemini GEM for writing in my voice | Personal writing assistant across languages |

## Framing Dos and Don'ts

### Always Include
- "Personal project" / "weekend experiment" / "hobby coding"
- Reference to how Salesforce is addressing the same space professionally
- Specific concrete examples from actual experience

### Never Include
- Implication that work tools are inadequate
- Suggestion that you built what Salesforce should provide
- Corporate product criticism

### Tone Markers
- "I was curious about..." not "I needed to solve..."
- "This helped me appreciate..." not "This proved that..."
- "Salesforce is building..." not "Salesforce should build..."

## Background Context

- Coding since teenage years as a hobby (databases, websites, backends, APIs, mobile apps)
- Solid understanding of software architecture and components
- Not a professional engineer—always amateur
- Had stopped coding due to effort-to-output ratio frustration
- AI reignited the joy of building; each model upgrade increased confidence
- Now building useful software again with AI as collaborator
