8AM meeting. Still half-asleep. A US colleague looks at me and asks: "Why are you always smiling?"

People tell me this often—usually as a compliment, sometimes with genuine curiosity. My answer that morning was simple: "Because I'm having fun."

But later, I found myself thinking about it more. Why *am* I smiling? It's not because everything is easy. It's not because I don't have bad days. So what is it?

**Part of it is fit.**

I'm in the right job, at the right company, doing work I genuinely enjoy. That matters. When your skills match your role and your values match your organization, showing up doesn't feel like a grind.

But fit alone doesn't explain it.

**The deeper answer is meaning.**

What gets me out of bed isn't hitting targets. It's what those targets represent.

I've spent 30 years in software sales. You could say my job is to help my company grow and help customers grow theirs. That's true. But that's not what I think about.

When software works, it doesn't just save time—it shifts what's possible. Someone who used to wait for answers can now find them. Someone who used to depend on specialists can now act on their own. Multiply that across thousands of users, and you're not selling software—you're changing people's lives.

That's meaningful to me. And having clarity on what's meaningful shapes everything else.

**It shapes how I lead.**

It would be easy to build a system where every decision flows through me. Approvals, sign-offs, check-ins—all requiring my input. Some leaders find that validating.

I find it exhausting. And counterproductive.

So I try to remove myself from the workflow wherever I can. Not because I'm disengaged—but because it frees me to be present where it actually matters. When someone is stuck. When a situation is ambiguous. When guidance would help. When a difficult executive decision is needed.

Leadership isn't about being everywhere. It's about being available where it counts.

**And it shapes how I handle setbacks.**

I'm a glass-half-full person. I default to optimism. That helps—people find it easier to work with someone who sees possibility rather than constantly bracing for disaster.

But optimism isn't just temperament. It's practice.

Bad days happen. Deals fall through. Plans collapse. When they do, I've learned to process it, find what's useful, and move forward. Not ignore it—absorb it and learn from it.

Does that mean I might miss risks? It's possible. So I've learned to make a conscious effort to consider worst-case scenarios. I build that discipline deliberately, because optimism without realism is just wishful thinking.

**So why am I smiling?**

That morning, my colleague caught me smiling before I'd had coffee. What she was really seeing, I think, was meaning.

Meaning in the work. Meaning in how I lead. Meaning in the mindset I've built over time.

Finding your meaning doesn't make work easy. But it makes showing up feel like the obvious thing to do.

So here's my question for you: What makes *you* smile in your job? And if the answer doesn't come easily, maybe that's worth exploring.
