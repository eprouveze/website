# Weekend Project Ideas: Research & Validation

*Research conducted: January 2026*

---

## Executive Summary

Based on current market research, the most viable weekend projects fall into three categories:

1. **AI-powered tools/wrappers** - Highest revenue potential ($5K-50K/month), requires technical skills
2. **Digital products/templates** - Fastest to launch, lowest maintenance, proven demand
3. **Chrome extensions** - Quick to build, viral potential, subscription or one-time pricing

Key insight from successful indie hackers: *"The wrapper isn't the value — the pre-built expertise is."* Tools like Cursor ($100M ARR) and Hints AI ($40K MRR) prove that solving specific pain points with AI backends is highly profitable.
