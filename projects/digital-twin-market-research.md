## 3. Competitive Landscape

### 3.1 Direct Competitors

| Competitor | Offering | Price | Weakness |
|------------|----------|-------|----------|
| Generic prompt packs | "Write like X" prompts | $19-39 | No methodology, single context |
| AI writing courses | How to use AI | $99-499 | Generic, not personalized |
| Custom GPT templates | Pre-built GPTs | $0-49 | Not personalized to user |
| Voice cloning services | Audio voice cloning | $50-500 | Audio only, not writing |

### 3.2 Indirect Competitors

| Competitor | Offering | Price | Weakness |
|------------|----------|-------|----------|
| Jasper/Copy.ai | AI writing platform | $49-99/mo | Subscription, generic voice |
| Grammarly | Writing enhancement | $12-30/mo | Corrects, doesn't clone voice |
