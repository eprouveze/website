# My Voice Twin Logo Prompts

Prompts for AI image generation tools (DALL-E, Midjourney, etc.)

---

## 1. Split Pen

**Primary Prompt:**
```
Minimalist logo design for "My Voice Twin", a single fountain pen nib that elegantly splits into two identical mirrored points at the tip, forming a subtle "V" shape. Clean vector style, modern and professional. The split creates symmetry suggesting twins/duality. Colors: deep blue (#1e40af) transitioning to teal (#0d9488). White background. Suitable for tech/SaaS branding. No text in the image.
```

**Variations:**
- Add: "with subtle ink drops falling from both tips"
- Add: "geometric, flat design, no gradients"
- Add: "the negative space between the split forms a subtle speech bubble"

## 2. Fingerprint + Cursor

**Primary Prompt:**
```
Minimalist logo design for "My Voice Twin", a stylized fingerprint pattern where one of the curved lines transforms into a blinking text cursor (|). Clean vector style, modern tech aesthetic. The fingerprint represents unique identity, the cursor represents writing/AI. Colors: gradient from deep blue (#1e40af) to purple (#7c3aed). White background. Suitable for tech/SaaS branding. No text in the image.
```

**Variations:**
- Add: "the cursor positioned at the center of the fingerprint"
- Add: "abstract, only showing partial fingerprint arcs with cursor"
- Add: "the fingerprint lines subtly form the letters VT"
