# User Journey Improvements

**Created**: January 2026
**Purpose**: Track feedback and improvements identified during user journey review

---

## Step 1: Landing Page

**Current State**: Sales-focused page with hero, problem/solution copy, pricing cards (4 tiers)

**Feedback/Improvements**:
- [ ] Missing copy for multilingual target users

---

## Step 2: Checkout Flow

**Current State**: User clicks pricing card on landing page → Stripe checkout → Success page (purchase-first flow)

**Feedback/Improvements**:
- [ ] **MAJOR**: Flow order is wrong. User should NOT see checkout first.
  - Correct flow: User builds their voice first (questionnaire + samples = Phase 1)
  - Only after Phase 1 is complete, show checkout
  - This ensures user is committed before paying (invested time/effort)
