# Weekend Side Project: Objective

## Goal

Build and deploy a revenue-generating side project in one weekend.

## Scope

This is not just about building a product—it's about shipping a complete, monetizable business:

- **Product**: A functional MVP that solves a real problem
- **Domain & Branding**: Professional domain name and minimal branding
- **Deployment**: Live and accessible to users
- **Payment System**: Integrated payment processing (Stripe, LemonSqueezy, Gumroad, etc.)
- **GTM Strategy**: Go-to-market plan with concrete launch actions
- **Marketing/Promotion**: Ideally automated or low-maintenance distribution channels

## Constraints

- **Time**: One weekend (roughly 16-20 focused hours)
- **Budget**: Minimal upfront costs
- **Maintenance**: Should require little ongoing maintenance
- **Solo execution**: Must be achievable by one person

## Success Criteria

1. Product is live and functional
2. Payment system accepts real transactions
3. At least one marketing channel is active
4. First users/customers acquired (or clear path to acquisition)

## Timeline

- **Saturday AM**: Finalize idea, secure domain, set up infrastructure
- **Saturday PM**: Build core product
- **Sunday AM**: Polish, integrate payments, deploy
- **Sunday PM**: Launch, execute GTM, promote
